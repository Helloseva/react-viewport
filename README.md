# Viewport Grid

## Task

  Single page application created that contains a uniform Grid of Viewports, with a fixed Sidebar. The Sidebar contains the inputs "Rows" and "Columns" both of which must be in the range of 1-10, and a button to collapse and expand the Sidebar. The Grid shows the defined number of "Rows" and "Columns", with a Viewport at each position. The Grid fills remaining space and fit all Viewports equally, with a small gutter between them, and efficiently adapt to browser resizes and Sidebar collapsing/expanding. Each Viewport has a thin border. Viewports also are aware of their size at all times and be printed at its center.
